  text: |
    Food insecurity is the most broadly-used measure of food deprivation in the United States. The USDA defines food insecurity as meaning “consistent access to adequate food is limited by a lack of money and other resources at times during the year.”

    Food insecurity is most prevalent in households containing children, disabled individuals or the elderly. Every Texas county is touched by the struggle to afford enough food.

    summary: |
      Hunger is not just a moral problem; it is also a health problem.

      If a family cannot avoid hunger, the resulting lack of nutrients reduces the body’s defenses against sickness, contributing to depressed student achievement, lowered worker productivity and avoidable health care costs.
