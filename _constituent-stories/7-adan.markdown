It's going to be a long two weeks off with my kids, admits Adan, a single father of three. His children ages 9, 10, and 14 all receive free or reduced-price breakfast and lunch. Adan is currently not working due to health issues, but has been working off and on for the past few years. "I was working as a mason, landscaping, and cooking in restaurants," he says. It has not been easy for Adan and his family, and he says that there have been times when his family has not had enough food. "There were times I didn't have any food, but I made sure my kids ate. I made sure they ate before I did. As long as they ate I was happy, it didn't matter to me," says Adan. "Being a single father and sticking with it and raising my kids up. That is the happiest thing that I'm proud of," says Adan.
