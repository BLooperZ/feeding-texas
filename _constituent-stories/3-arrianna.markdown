Arrianna is in third grade at Travis Heights Elementary school. "My favorite subject is science because we get to do experiments," says Arrianna. At school, Arrianna receives free breakfast and lunch and her favorite things to eat are spaghetti, macaroni and fish sticks. "Sometimes I don't have any food at home and I feel hungry. I usually eat whatever's left. I feel bad when I'm hungry," says Arrianna. Arrianna lives with her father, stepmother and three siblings. She says her father lost his job and it has been a long time since he has been out of work. Across Texas, children are starting their first day of school and already children like Arrianna are at a disadvantage before they put pencil to paper.
