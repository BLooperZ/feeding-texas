MEDIA ADVISORY for 3/26/14   
Contact: Celia Cole, 512-590-0659, ccole@tfbn.org 

**What:**  Afterschool and summer program providers and administrators of the federal child nutrition programs throughout Texas will attend *Eliminating Hunger After School and During Summer Vacation* to learn how they can implement and expand federally funded programming to eliminate hunger experienced by children after school, on weekends, during school holiday breaks and summer vacation.

The summit, organized by the Food Research and Action Center (FRAC) and three of Texasâ€™ leading anti-hunger organizations, will provide a forum for current and potential afterschool and summer meal providers to share their successes and outline opportunities for growth in the Summer and Afterschool Meal Program for low-income children in Texas.

**When:**  Wednesday, March 26, 2014, 8 a.m. to 3:30 p.m.

**Where:**  Mexican-American Unity Council, 2300 W. Commerce, Community Room, San Antonio, TX 78207

**Why:**  More than 18 percent of Texas households struggle with hunger, and one in four children live in poverty.  Extending the reach of the Summer Nutrition Programs and the Afterschool Meal Program to all eligible communities throughout the state will ensure that the children of Texas are free from hunger, get nutrition they need, and experience the health and education benefits of a healthy and adequate diet.
