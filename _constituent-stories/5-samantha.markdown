Samantha is 17 and homeless. "I've been homeless for ten weeks. My mother drove me here from San Antonio because my father kicked me out. I didn't tell her that we had no where to live because I knew she wouldn't bring me," says Samantha. She has been in-and-out of foster homes and has been through many difficult family situations. Samantha has diabetes and is five months pregnant. She says that she always has access to food because of places like Father Joe's House, a food pantry at St. Ignatius Martyr Catholic Church in South Austin. She says it's sometimes difficult to find the nutritious food she needs to control her diabetes and support her baby. "Fresh produce is expensive. I haven't really had any since I have been here," says Samantha. "I have to make the choice between a small amount of fresh produce and a cheeseburger. They are the same price but the cheeseburger will fill me up for longer," she says.
