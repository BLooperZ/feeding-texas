  title: Our Role in Fighting Hunger in Texas
  text: |
    TFBN plays a statewide, coordinating role in areas too large for any one food bank. These include disaster relief, public policy advocacy, and partnerships with statewide entities.

    We also help the network of 20 regional food banks to build the capacity to end hunger by managing statewide food sourcing and purchasing programs, offering expert technical assistance and training, and spreading food bank innovations and best practices statewide.

      Hunger is not just a moral problem; it is also a health problem.

      If a family cannot avoid hunger, the resulting lack of nutrients reduces the bodyâ€™s defenses against sickness, contributing to depressed student achievement, lowered worker productivity and avoidable health care costs.
