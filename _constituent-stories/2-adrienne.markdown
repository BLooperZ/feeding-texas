Adrienne and her husband Jerry do their best to provide for their children Eli (12), Leti (8) and Ladi (2). Adriana's family has been struggling to get by after she lost her retail job several months ago. Even with Jerry's full-time job as a locksmith, it's not enough to get by. He worries about how he'll make ends meet. At times, he can't sleep. At one point, she had plans for a new career in social work and was only a semester away from graduating when she needed to put those plans on hold to support the family. She definitely wants to finish her degree someday, but she wants to ensure her family is provided for first. Meanwhile, they are still paying her school loans while she continues to look for work.
