Have you ever felt the pangs of hunger? It's not pleasant. Just ask Tiffany. "I frequently go without food. I feed my children first and go without," says Tiffany. She continued "my children understand the sacrifice I make. They thank me everyday. I don't have a job right now, and my husband doesn't pay child support for our five children." Her children are between the ages of 12 and 18. "It's extremely difficult being a single mother. It's a struggle living every day," says Tiffany.
