The proud mother of eleven children, Rosie was a homemaker because her husband's income made it possible for her to stay at home. Despite having such a large family, they never had to go without. She has lived in Taylor,"all my life," she explained. Rosie remembers when the town was smaller, with a bustling town square and a closeknit community. Now, downtown Taylor is littered with empty store fronts and there are few job prospects for young people to stay. Most of all, Rosie remembers when she didn't have to wait in line for a box of groceries.
