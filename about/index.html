  key: Texas families experienced food insecurity in 2010-2012

intro: |
  Texas leads the nation in opportunity, but many Texans who are striving for a better life still struggle to put food on the table.

  Faced with rising food prices and tight budgets, these families must make difficult choices between food and other needs.

  The Texas miracle is incomplete as long as our fellow Texans struggle against hunger. A hunger-free Texas is possible if we all work together.
