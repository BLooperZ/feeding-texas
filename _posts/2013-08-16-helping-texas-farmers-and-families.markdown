Administered by TDA, the Texans Feeding Texans (Surplus Ag) grant helps the Texas food banks provide hungry families with more than 12 pounds of Texas-grown produce for every $1. 

The program leverages the statewide infrastructure of the Texas Food Bank Network (TFBN) to solicit donated produce that would otherwise go to waste while reimbursing Texas farmers for their expenses. 

**How it works:** 
 
- TFBN and its agents solicit farmers who have excess produce in their fields that would otherwise go to waste. These farmers are offered up to $.10 per pound to offset the gleaning and packaging costs associated with a donation. 
- TFBN offers this food to its 21 member food banks, whose distribution networks feed 3 million Texans annually in every Texas county. 
- The food is efficiently distributed to hungry families through local food pantries and soup kitchens. 
- TFBN expects to provide nearly 20 million pounds of healthy, Texas-grown produce to hungry families during the current two-year grant cycle. 

**Why itâ€™s needed:**
- Texas ranks among the eight states with the highest rates of food insecurity. Texas has the second highest number of food-insecure households in the nation. 
- Low-income families struggle to afford healthy, unprocessed foods, which tend to cost more on a per-calorie basis. This problem is especially acute in urban and rural food deserts, where access to fresh produce is scarce. 
- Increasing the size of this grant would reduce hunger, promote health and support Texas farmers by securing an additional 12 pounds of produce for every $1 invested. 
- Doubling the program (currently $1.6 million) would provide an additional 20 million pounds of produce, equivalent to more than 15 million meals for needy Texans.
