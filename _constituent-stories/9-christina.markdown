Christina Sanchez, who was featured in our latest edition of Feedback, knows firsthand the stress of putting a child through college. Her and her husband both work, but their combined income isn't enough to take care of their children and her mother. Christina's oldest daughter attends college at the University of Texas on a pre-med scholarship. She is extremely grateful for her daughter's scholarship, knowing that otherwise her family wouldn't be able to afford tuition. "Even with both of us working, it's really hard to pay the bill, let alone [buy] groceries," Christina explains. "Do we go without electricity or buy food? Do we not pay rent and get kicked out or buy food?"
